# Ground-truth cone map for perception evaluation
# Format: x,y,z (meters, in velodyne/LiDAR frame)
# Lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# How to create this file:
#   1. Park the vehicle at the start position (same as bag recording start).
#   2. Measure cone positions relative to the LiDAR sensor.
#      - x: forward (m), y: left (m), z: up (m)
#   3. For static scenes (vehicle not moving), list all visible cones.
#   4. For dynamic scenes, this file represents the ego-frame cone map
#      at the recording start; the evaluator matches per-frame detections
#      against this static map (suitable for stationary vehicle tests).
#
# Example (4 cones forming a short track segment):
3.0,1.5,0.0
3.0,-1.5,0.0
8.0,1.5,0.0
8.0,-1.5,0.0
