# Line Detection Configuration File
# This file contains all configurable parameters for the straight line detection
# and path planning using Hough transform algorithm.

# Hough Transform Parameters
hough:
  # Resolution for rho (distance from origin) in meters
  rho_resolution: 0.1

  # Resolution for theta (angle) in radians
  theta_resolution: 0.01

  # Minimum number of votes to consider a line valid
  min_votes: 3

  # Tolerance for theta angle when selecting parallel boundary lines (radians)
  theta_tolerance: 0.2

# Cone Filtering Parameters
cones:
  # Maximum cone distance to consider from vehicle (meters)
  max_distance: 50.0

  # Minimum cone distance to consider from vehicle (meters)
  min_distance: 2.0

# Path Generation Parameters
path:
  # Interval between path points (meters)
  interval: 0.1

  # Maximum path distance for the straight track (meters)
  # This is typically the length of the acceleration track (75m for FSAE)
  max_distance: 75.0

# Vehicle Parameters
vehicle:
  # IMU to lidar offset in x direction (meters)
  # Used for coordinate transformation from vehicle to world frame
  imu_offset_x: 1.88

# Finish Line Detection
finish:
  # Distance threshold for detecting finish line (meters)
  # When vehicle reaches within this distance of the finish line,
  # the finish signal is published
  threshold: 2.0

# Topic Names
